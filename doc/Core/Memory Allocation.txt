How to allocate vertex buffer memory in bitmap font rendering:

1. VertexBuffer allocates memory in global heap. Users use VertexBuffer's memory
   for static and dynamic drawing. User would like to have one VertexBuffer for
   static drawing, which rarely rewritten; User would have another one for
   dynamic drawing, which is rewritten every frame.

2. VertexBuffer allocates memory from Users' memory pool. Users would use the
   VertexBuffer in the same method in 1. Memory pool would be similar to
   https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/15527/C-Memory-Pool.

3. VertexBuffer take allocated memory from users. Users are using memory
   segmentation to allocate contiguous memory space and recycle discarded
   VertexBuffers using circular buffer and linked list.

I am using first method.
