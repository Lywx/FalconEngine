How vertex format is used with other resources:

1. Vertex format could be shared cross shaders if shaders are using the same vertex input.
2. Vertex format could be shared cross vertex buffers if vertex buffers are
   using the same vertex layout when the underlying shaders are using the same
   vertex input.
