The design of Visual ensure that every derived class would be able to share
vertex buffer using different offset into the same buffer. The direct result of
this design is that the vertex number should not depend on the vertex buffer
itself. The vertex number should be recorded for each Primitive (or Visual). 

The problem is when should I initialize the vertex number or primitive number
information in the Primitive class. 

Eventually, I put a pure virtual function SetPrimitiveNum inside Primitive class
so that derived class constructor would finish initialize the vertex number and
primitive number.
